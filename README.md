# Why Employees Quit

In the last two decades, 2021 holds the highest rates of resignation and employee turnover rates that organizations have witnessed. In 2021 alone, 47.8 million people quit their jobs. This was an estimated 4 million people per month. Although this phenomenon, which has been termed as the 'Great Resignation' happened majorly in the United States and other western countries, it does not mean that organizations in Africa are immune. This trend of employees quitting their jobs has continued into 2022 causing concerns to many organizations who are incurring losses in hiring and retraining new staff only for them to quit before they have capitalized on that investment. Many studies have been done on factors that influence employee turnover. Some of the findings state that employees tend to want aspects such as adequate monetary compensation and benefits but also non-monetary aspects such as shared identity and values with the organization, good organization culture and working environment, meaningful and challenging work, good interpersonal connections with fellow employees, understanding and open management amongst many other factors. This project is a predictive analysis using pyCaret; a machine learning library that compares several algorithms and will hence predict which employees are likely to quit and which are not based on various factors in relation to the data collected. The accuracy aimed for is 0.9

## Objectives

- To to come up with an exploratory data analysis process showing who you are analyzing the data

- To Capture insights you are noticing during the exploratory data analysis;

- To use predictive analytics to predict likelihood of an employee leaving the company with an accuracy of 0.9
## Model 

pyCaret library was used and several models were analyzed 
to find the best model with an accuracy of at least 0.9.

5 Best Models	                    Accuracy

- Random Forest 	                 98.3%

- Light Gradient Boosting Machine	98.02%

- Extra Trees Classifier	        97.31%

- Gradient Boosting Classifier	    97.13%

- Decision Tree Classifier	        96.15%

## Conclusion

- The reasons that employees leave their jobs can be complex.

- Factors such as job satisfaction, hours worked, evaluation, salary, workload, and promotion play an important role in employee turnover.

- Companies ignoring employees' satisfaction, efforts and productivity can cause them to leave.

- Employers should stay aware of competitor efforts and make sure to appreciate employee efforts through promotions, monetary  and non-monetary appreciation.

- Work accidents do not play an important role in influencing why employees quit.
## Recommendations

- The company needs to value its most productive employees and reward them with a salary increase and/or promotions.

- The company should also avoid overwhelming employees with lots of projects and long working hours but should advocate for a fair workload and work-life balance.

- To keep employees motivated and engaged, the firm needs to promote upskilling through training.

- Lastly, the company should promote an open, transparent, and meritocratic culture where all employees are valued, treated fairly  and experience job satisfaction.
